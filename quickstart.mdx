## Create your WayPay account

To use the WayPay Merchant APIs, first create an account:

- Go to: https://waypay-dev-web.icydesert-41d42f7e.uaenorth.azurecontainerapps.io
- Click Sign Up and complete the registration form.
- Verify your email address.
- Provide required business details for compliance review.
- Wait for approval. You’ll be notified once your account is active.

<Note>
  Your API access becomes available only after your account is approved and active.
</Note>

## Get your API key

Once approved:
- Sign in to the portal.
- Locate your API key in the dashboard.
- Copy it securely. Never commit keys to source control.

All API requests must include this header:
- Swich-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY

<Warning>
  Treat your API key like a password. Rotate it immediately if exposed.
</Warning>

## Make your first API call

Set your key in the terminal:

```bash
export SWICH_API_KEY="sk_live_XXXX"
```

Create a hosted checkout payment intent:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.swich.com/Gateway/v1/Payment/initiate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Swich-API-Key: $SWICH_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "amountMinor": 50000,
    "currency": "PKR",
    "description": "Order 12345",
    "orderRef": { "orderRef": "ORD12345" },
    "successUrl": "https://merchant.example.com/checkout/success",
    "cancelUrl": "https://merchant.example.com/checkout/cancel"
  }'
```

You should receive a response with `paymentIntentId` and `checkoutUrl`.

### Charge a tokenized mobile wallet (optional)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.swich.com/Gateway/v1/Payment/charge-mobile-wallet" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Swich-API-Key: $SWICH_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "token": "tok_mwallet_9xK3PQrA",
    "mobileNumber": "+923001234567",
    "amount": 1500.0,
    "billReference": "INV-98127",
    "description": "Wallet charge for order ORD-98127",
    "last6CNICDigits": "123456"
  }'
```

### Issue a refund (optional)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.swich.com/Gateway/v1/Refunds" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Swich-API-Key: $SWICH_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "trxnRef": "trx_7ZP8X2",
    "amount": 500.0,
    "reason": "Customer returned the item"
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

- 401 Unauthorized  
  Ensure the header is present and correct:
  -H "Swich-API-Key: $SWICH_API_KEY"

- 400 Validation error  
  Check your payload fields and formats (e.g., description length and characters).

  See the full API reference and schema at <code>/docs/api-reference/openapi.json</code>, and endpoint examples under API Reference → Endpoints.

## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your dashboard.
    
    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the Cloning a repository guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Start the preview server">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: <code>npm i -g mint</code>
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: <code>mint dev</code>
    3. Open <code>http://localhost:3000</code> to see your docs live!
    
    <Tip>Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Install our GitHub app">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your dashboard.
    
    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Update your site name and colors">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open <code>docs.json</code> in your editor.
    2. Change the <code>"name"</code> field to your project name.
    3. Update the <code>"colors"</code> to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.

    <Tip>Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Publish your docs">
