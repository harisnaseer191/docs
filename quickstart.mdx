## Create your WayPay account

To use the WayPay Merchant APIs, first create an account:

- Go to: https://waypay-dev-web.icydesert-41d42f7e.uaenorth.azurecontainerapps.io
- Click Sign Up and complete the registration form (business name, contact, email, phone).
- Verify your email address via the link sent to your inbox.
- Provide required business details and documents for compliance (KYC/KYB).
- Submit for review and wait for approval. You’ll be notified once your account is active.

<Note>
  Your API access becomes available only after your account is approved and active. Approval timelines vary based on compliance review completeness.
</Note>

## Get your API key

Once approved:
- Sign in to the merchant portal.
- Locate your API key in the dashboard.
- Copy it securely. Never commit keys to source control.
- Use separate keys per environment and rotate them periodically.

All API requests must include this header:
- Swich-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY

<Warning>
  Treat your API key like a password. Rotate it immediately if exposed.
</Warning>

## Make your first API call

Set your key in the terminal:

```bash
export SWICH_API_KEY="sk_live_XXXX"
```

Create a hosted checkout payment intent:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://waypay-merchant-api.icydesert-41d42f7e.uaenorth.azurecontainerapps.io/Gateway/v1/Payment/initiate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Swich-API-Key: $SWICH_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "amountMinor": 50000,
    "currency": "PKR",
    "description": "Order 12345",
    "orderRef": { "orderRef": "ORD12345" },
    "successUrl": "https://merchant.example.com/checkout/success",
    "cancelUrl": "https://merchant.example.com/checkout/cancel"
  }'
```

You should receive a response with `paymentIntentId` and `checkoutUrl`.

### Charge a tokenized mobile wallet (optional)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://waypay-merchant-api.icydesert-41d42f7e.uaenorth.azurecontainerapps.io/Gateway/v1/Payment/charge-mobile-wallet" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Swich-API-Key: $SWICH_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "token": "tok_mwallet_9xK3PQrA",
    "mobileNumber": "+923001234567",
    "amount": 1500.0,
    "billReference": "INV-98127",
    "description": "Wallet charge for order ORD-98127",
    "last6CNICDigits": "123456"
  }'
```

### Issue a refund (optional)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://waypay-merchant-api.icydesert-41d42f7e.uaenorth.azurecontainerapps.io/Gateway/v1/Refunds" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Swich-API-Key: $SWICH_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "trxnRef": "trx_7ZP8X2",
    "amount": 500.0,
    "reason": "Customer returned the item"
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

- 401 Unauthorized  
  Ensure the header is present and correct:
  -H "Swich-API-Key: $SWICH_API_KEY"

- 400 Validation error  
  Check your payload fields and formats (e.g., description length and characters).
